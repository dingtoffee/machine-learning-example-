Machine Learning in CyberSecurity - Intrusion Detection examples - DataSet and Training Scripts

This repo documents the use cases I developed to enable anomaly detection via Machine Learning. 

Training/Testing dataset and also python script will be provided. On each of the use case, you could also take a look at the ReadMe to understand how I develop this model.
